# Capstone-Project-Fe

- Project idea: Grocery web app.
The idea I got interested in for my capstone project is to make a web application to make the burden of going to do grocery shopping less heavy.

- The concept is all about having an interface where the user can navigate through different grocery stores near his set location, check what the store has available, being able to see the prices, the brand and all the important infos about it (expiring date, allergens, etc...), comparing the results between 2 (or more) picked grocery stores.

- The user will be able to set up a calendar, planning his grocery based on his habits.

- Users will be allowed to change their set location in any moment, 

- Based on the users set location, the app will show a ranked list of the grocery stores nearby, created based on the number of times the stores are getting chosen from every user.

- If the user has already in mind a clear recipe, it will be possible to insert all the needed ingredients and the server will be looking for the stores that have them all in the catalog.

- An added feature would be to be able to select a dish cathegory, getting a list of recipes, selecting one specific recipe and getting redirected to the closest grocery store with everything available in stock. 



- v1. User login interface, home page with grocery stores listing. Grocery stores API research

- v2. Grocery stores ranking, making use of a ranking algorithm.

- v3. User calendar, recipes list and recipe research.

- v4. Grocery stores data retrieving interface.
